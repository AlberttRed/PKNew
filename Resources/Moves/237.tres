effect_entries = "Power and type depend upon user's IVs.  Power can range from 30 to 70. Inflicts regular damage.  Power and type are determined by the user's IVs.

Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)

Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.

Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.

Value | Type
----: | --------
    0 | fighting
    1 | flying
    2 | poison
    3 | ground
    4 | rock
    5 | bug
    6 | ghost
    7 | steel
    8 | fire
    9 | water
   10 | grass
   11 | electric
   12 | psychic
   13 | ice
   14 | dragon
   15 | dark

This move thus cannot be normal.  Most other types have an equal 1/16 chance to be selected, given random IVs.  However, due to the flooring used here, bug, fighting, and grass appear 5/64 of the time, and dark only 1/64 of the time."
