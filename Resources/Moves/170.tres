One-hit KO moves are also guaranteed to hit, as long as the user is equal or higher level than the target.  This effect also allows the user to hit Pokémon that are off the field due to moves such as dig or fly.

If the target uses detect or protect while under the effect of this move, the user is not guaranteed to hit, but has a (100 - accuracy)% chance to break through the protection.

This effect is passed on by baton pass."
