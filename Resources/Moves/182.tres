If the user successfully used detect, endure, protect, quick guard, or wide guard on the last turn, this move has a 50% chance to fail.

lock on, mind reader, and no guard provide a (100 – accuracy)% chance for moves to break through this move.  This does not apply to one-hit KO moves (fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold); those are always blocked by this move.

thunder during rain dance and blizzard during hail have a 30% chance to break through this move.

The following effects are not prevented by this move:

* acupressure from an ally
* curse's curse effect
* Delayed damage from doom desire and future sight; however, these moves will be prevented if they are used this turn
* feint, which will also end this move's protection after it hits
* imprison
* perish song
* shadow force
* Moves that merely copy the user, such as transform or psych up

This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome."
